# Phase 1: Foundations & CI/CD
The goal of phase one was to integrate Github Actions into my workflow, setup automated testing, and establish a basic DevOps work environment. 

## Major tasks included: Version control, refining git workflow, using .gitignore to hide sensitive data, setup a CI pipeline, linting, TypeScript type checking, setting up unit tests, trigger pipeline on push/PRs to main branch, environment variables & secrets, refactoring code to pull from .env securely, code-quality best practices, enforcement of eslint in CI pipeline, ensured relavant rules are active, fully-automated CI pipeline for linting, type checking, and tests, securely managing .env variables.
